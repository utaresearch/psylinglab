# UTA Psycholinguistics Lab

The Psycholinguistics Lab in the Linguistics and TESOL Department at UT Arlington has been experimenting with a version of DMDX (created by Kenneth Forster and Jonathan Forster) that allows for remote testing. This web-deployable version of DMDX provides a convenient way for language researchers to gather experimental data on languages whose speakers are hard to come by.

This git respository contains the sample, demo, and experiment-based executables for the project at UTA. For additional information, please see Dr. Jeffrey Witzel's website at https://blog.uta.edu/jeffreyw/remote-dmdx/ or the Psycholinguistics Lab website at https://psycholinguisticslab.uta.edu.
